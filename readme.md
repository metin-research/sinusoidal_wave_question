## Description
This code generates a sinusoidal wave for with a phase angle for a question (file: question.pdf) asked in the final exam for the Principle of Electrical and Electronics Engineering module.
The question asks for the time t_1 when the generated sinusoidal cross the time axix for the first time after t=0.
 
 The qeustion is inspired by the problems of Chapter 10 of the book "*Introductory Circuit Analysis*" 11th ed. by Robert L. Boylestad, Pearson, Prentice Hall.
